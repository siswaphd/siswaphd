## Background and research interest

Just some projects and applications that I have been working on, or some stuffs that I am currently learning. Good to put some stufss here to share, and as good documentation for future references. I learned a lot from the internet, and time to pay it forward ðŸ˜„

I am interested mainly in data science, particulalry in <b> spatial analysis, remote sensing, machine learning, time-series analysis, statistic, and map/data visualisation.</b>
